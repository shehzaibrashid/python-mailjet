'''These are the default settings, DON'T MODIFY THIS FILE!

If (some) of these settings need changing, do that in `settings.py` instead


The global settings prefix can be changed by modifying the `SETTINGS_PREFIX`
variable. These settings can be overwritten by modifying the Django settings
(in that case the `SETTINGS_PREFIX` is used) or by modifying `settings.py`
